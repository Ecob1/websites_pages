      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This is a website for a business located by the Boise River near Boise, Idaho. This is a popular place for 
        locals and tourists to float down the river. On this website local and visiting people can schedule, reserve, and pay 
        for the rental of rafts, paddle boats, kayaks, and canoes. Prices are given by hour or by day. Free life jackets 
        and paddles (if applicable) are included with the rentals. Price of rental includes pickup of rental water crafts and life 
        jackets. A shuttle is also offered for customers at a minimal cost. Payment can be made by credit card, debit card, or paypal.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of this website is anyone who is adventurous and enjoys water sports. This website will try to attract 
        nature lovers, active recreationalists, families, youth groups, and anyone looking for a day spent in the great outdoors. However, 
        this website tailors to those who do not already own their own kayaks, canoes, rafts, and paddle boards. Those enthusiasts would 
        likely not need to rent equipment. So perhaps the audience of this website is those who are able to get away and enjoy 
        the Boise River occasionally. Due to the nature of the reserve and pay before format of this website, the audience 
        for the site is also those who plan ahead and consider equipment they will need.</p>

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
