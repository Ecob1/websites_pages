        I would like to find a job where I can do coding from home. I have a lot of hobbies, such as 
       silversmithing, woodworking, and oil painting. However, since I've started working on my online degree, I don't have time for them. I have been married to my wife 
        for 19 years, and we have five children--one girl and four boys.
       
        I work at a gold mine in Nevada as a diesel mechanic and my work schedule requires me to work 
        12 hour shifts. I also have about a two hours commute each way, which makes for a long day. I look forward to a new career as a programmer.
        I am so grateful that I was able to take Pathway. This is a blessing because it allows me to take classes on line. I love how BYU-Idaho gives me the opportunity to fit classes into my busy life. I am pursuing a BS degree.
        It is amazing to learn how to create web pages. By taking this class I hope to learn what is needed 
        to became a web designer.  I have been a member of the Church since 2001. I joined the church when I was 25 years old.
