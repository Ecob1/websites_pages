His Atonement so freely given makes our salvation possible, but we have to do our part. We learn in D&C 20:25 that we must believe, but that is not all. That verse says, “as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and bendure in faith to the end, should be saved.” The fourth Article of Faith explains more about baptism and also about what our part is in our own salvation. These first principles and ordinances of the gospel need to be done in a certain way and by certain authority. I like how the scripture in D&C 128:8 tells how it is by the power of the priesthood that baptism and bestowing the gift of the Holy Ghost are performed. This verse also tells how the ordinances must be recorded. If they are recorded on earth, they are also recorded in heaven. This same formula for salvation is timeless. It was the same for Adam and Eve (as we read in the Pearl of Great Price) as it is for us today. D&C 20:26 explains that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is for those who believed after He came to earth and also for those who came before He came. D&C 76:53 explains more what it means to endure to the end. Enduring to the end is what we do after we have completed the first principles and ordinances of the gospel listed in the fourth Article of Faith. This verse tells who will receive Celestial glory:  those “who aovercome by faith, and are bsealed by the Holy Spirit of cpromise, which the Father dsheds forth upon all those who are just and true.” Of course, this is what we all want. I am thankful for the doctrine in the fourth Article of Faith because is explains the first important steps I must take in doing my part in being saved.

                Why is it not enough just to believe in Jesus and confess He is our Savior? Why do we have to have faith, repent, be baptized, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost?   </p>
