        <strong>Buckaroo Spurs #559</strong><br>
        These buckaroo style spurs are made of polished, blued steel. The bands are 5/8 of an inch wide, inlayed with engraved sterling silver on the outside and engraved in the steel on the inside. They have 2 1/4 inch shanks which are silvered and engraved on both sides and the top. The rowels are 2 1/4 inches with 16 points. With the long bands and high, swinging buttons, they will hang very well on a boot and they do have posts to attach heel chains that would probably never be needed.
