      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How can a cowboy heritage craft be shared with the whole world? My father-in-law is a renowned bridle bit and spur maker. He has taught me some of his craft, and I am passionate about learning it and sharing it with my children. It is part of their legacy. I will create a website where my father-in-law can display his art and the items he has for sale. This will allow his unique style and amazing talent to be showcased and enjoyedâ€”including his posterity.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience for this website is potential customers, western heritage art collectors, and family and friends of Mark Dahl. His gear is fully operational and sought after by buckaroos everywhere. It is also beautiful art, and serious art collectors of western gear would also want his pieces to add to a collection. Finally, those close to Mark, value his work and want to see his latest pieces. Since many of these people are far away, this website gives them a chance to stay current with his work.</p>  <!-- change this  Edgar work here adding 75 to 100 word.-->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

        <strong>Buckaroo Spurs #559</strong><br>These buckaroo style spurs are made of polished, blued steel. The bands are 5/8 of an inch wide, inlayed with engraved sterling silver on the outside and engraved in the steel on the inside. They have 2 1/4 inch shanks which are silvered and engraved on both sides and the top. The rowels are 2 1/4 inches with 16 points. With the long bands and high, swinging buttons, they will hang very well on a boot and they do have posts to attach heel chains that would probably never be needed.
